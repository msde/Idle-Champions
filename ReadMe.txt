Warning: This script reads system memory. I do not know CNE's stance on reading system memory used by the game, so use at your own risk. Pointers may break on any given update and I may no longer decide to update them.

Modron.AHK may no longer be updated and should be considered legacy. If someone wants to take over, feel free. As of 2/26/21 it should function very close to ModronGUI.AHK, without a GUI.

Instructions for ModronGUI.AHK:
1. Download ModronGUI.AHK, IC_Pointers.AHK, and classMemory.AHK to the same folder.
2. Right click ModronGUI.AHK and select run.
3. Read all of and follow the instructions on the 'Read First' tab.
