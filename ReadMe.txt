Warning: This script reads system memory. I do not know CNE's stance on reading system memory used by the game, so use at your own risk. Pointers may break on any given update and I may no longer decide to update them.

Modron.AHK may no longer be updated and should be considered legacy. If someone wants to take over, feel free. As of 2/26/21 it should function very close to ModronGUI.AHK, without a GUI.

Instructions for ModronGUI.AHK:
1. Download and install AutoHotkey: https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download ModronGUI.AHK, IC_Pointers.AHK, and classMemory.AHK to the same folder.
3. Scan all downloaded files with trusted antivirus software.
4. Right click ModronGUI.AHK and select run script.
5. Read and follow the instructions on the 'Read First' tab.

Recommended Additional Steps:
Review AutoHotkey tutorials and documentation.

Notes:
1. Script requires Shandie to be used in your save slot 1 (q) formation to function properly.
2. Script can be used outside of Grand Tour Campaign, but Shandie's location will have to be interpolated. Top right position in the formation corresponds to Slot 0. Numbering proceeds down the column from top to bottom, then through the formation from left to right. For example Grand Tour:
    3
  6    1
8   4     0
  7    2
    5
